# Hack Club Bank Widget

A [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) widget to easily view [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank) projects' balance and transactions.

## Setup

1. Install the [Scriptable app](https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/). Built and tested on macOS, should theoretically work with the [iOS version](https://scriptable.app) as well.
2. Copy the script from [`index.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggie-j-liu/bank-widget/main/index.js).
3. Follow the steps in this video: ![demo video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63619830/188041318-91e8fc38-125e-42de-b389-1d3adca0a793.mov)  
   The widget's parameter should be the slug or organization (the part after `bank.hackclub.com/` in your project's URL) of your Hack Club Bank project. Make sure Transparency Mode is turned on.
